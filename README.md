# PhotonicMockSim
an optical computer simulation suite.

It is a Java 8 application with the Java 8 MVC pattern. It is capable of simulation and with it it is possible to design modules chips and mothreboards.

Please note that this software was developed by me when I was learning Java thus there is some bad coding and it will be replaced on a need to basis. I put the project 
here for collaboration and I need help specificially with the building of the execution queue. At the moment the circuit is in a graph. A part has 1 or more layers
which has 1 or more modules wheich has 1 or more components. The execution queue builds a list of optical pathways from an (deemed) input port to an output port. This
execution queue mechanism is a weakness in the project as with complex feedback loops you have to include an optical coupler 1 to many to link in the feedback loop.

If anyone can help with this project then I will be delighted to hear from you.!!

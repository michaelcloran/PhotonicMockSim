# PhotonicMockSim
an optical computer simulation suite.

@13/9/22 currently working on a fork to add CPU bus capability. Keep an eye on my blog https://photoniccomputer.blogspot.com/

It is a Java 8 application with the Java 8 MVC pattern. It is capable of simulation and with it it is possible to design modules chips and mothreboards.

Please note that this software was developed by me when I was learning Java thus there is some bad coding and it will be replaced on a need to basis. I put the project 
here for collaboration and I need help specificially with the building of the execution queue. At the moment the circuit is in a graph. A part has 1 or more layers
which has 1 or more modules wheich has 1 or more components. The execution queue builds a list of optical pathways from a (deemed) input port to an output port. This
execution queue mechanism is a weakness in the project as with complex feedback loops you have to include an optical coupler 1 to many to link in the feedback loop.

If anyone can help with this project then I will be delighted to hear from you.!!

I am stuck for a while I am reading the Git and GitHub manuals and cant seem to get my local to sync with remote or something like that!! I have to read the manuals!!!.

As time goes on and when the system upgrade is done I will add to the documentation and show you what this system is capable of!!.
Regards
Michael
